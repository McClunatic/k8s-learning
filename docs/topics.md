# Learning topics

McCl8s was conceived with the idea of "learning K8s", but that idea is a
fuzzy umbrella: it's not clear exactly what it covers. At a high level,
the McCl8s project is meant to help learn:

1. **The basics of IT automation.** K8s itself needs to be installed, and
   its control and worker nodes configured to support deployment.
2. **K8s concepts.** Understanding what K8s is for, its conceptual structure,
   its design and its components, is prerequisite to understanding how to
   use it.
3. **K8s management.** Learning how to use K8s means learning how to manage
   K8s application, resource, and policy objects.
4. **K8s-native tools and applications.** There are K8s-native applications
   to simplify and scale software development and ML lifecycles, including
   CI/CD, workflow pipelines, model training, and application and model
   serving and monitoring.
