# McCl8s

McCl8s is a tongue-in-cheek portmanteau of my last name and
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), or K8s. It is **not** a custom
implementation of K8s, but a name for the collection of applications
and resources deployed using [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io) as a
platform for experimentation and learning.

## Sections

  targeted for learning as part of building McCl8s.

  foundation hardware and software used to build McCl8s.
