# Learning Kubernetes

This repository will document resources and training to learn Kubernetes.

## Resources

* [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)
* [Kubernetes Tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/)
* [Kubernetes on Windows with WSL 2 and Microk8s](https://youtu.be/DmfuJzX6vJQ)
* [Nuxt Installation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation)

## Setup

### Installing Microk8s

Follow linked guidance to run
[Kubernetes on Windows with WSL 2 and Microk8s](https://youtu.be/DmfuJzX6vJQ).
Two things to note while reading the referenced blog detailing setup:

1. As of September 2022,
   [systemd is now available in WSL](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/systemd-support-is-now-available-in-wsl/)!
2. The multi-node setup is nice, but not strictly necessary for a learning
   environment.

### Creating a Nuxt app

The `nuxt-app/` directory in this repository was created following
[Nuxt Installation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation)
guidance. To run the "Welcome to Nuxt" app, with Node.js installed, run

```shell
> npm run dev -- -o
```
